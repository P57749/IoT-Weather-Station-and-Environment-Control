**Real-Time Weather Monitoring System**

## Description

The Real-Time Weather Monitoring System is an innovative project that aims to provide live weather data and updates from various sensors. This system utilizes a combination of hardware sensors, a data processing backend, and a user-friendly web interface to offer real-time and periodic weather information to users.

## Features

- Live Data Streaming: The system allows sensors for lightning, wind direction, wind speed, and rainfall to transmit live data, ensuring users receive real-time weather updates.

- Periodic Updates: Other sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, transmit data at regular intervals of 1 minute, providing timely and accurate information.

- Interactive Web Interface: The web-based user interface offers an intuitive and interactive platform for users to access weather data from different sensors and view live updates.

- Sensor Status Indication: The interface visually displays the status of each sensor, distinguishing real-time data sources from periodic ones.

- Historical Data: Users can access historical weather data through the system, facilitating trend analysis and long-term planning.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the documentation.
3. Connect the hardware sensors to the system and ensure proper configuration.
4. Run the backend server and start data processing.
5. Access the web interface to view live weather updates and periodic sensor data.

## Usage

1. Open the web interface in your preferred web browser.
2. Navigate through different sections to access real-time and periodic weather data.
3. Check the status of sensors and monitor live weather changes.
4. Use the historical data feature to analyze past weather patterns.
